# HobPane
Make life with vim windows easier. The term `pane` is adopted from tmux ;).
<br/>
Tested with vim 8.0 on Windows 10,
    but should work for older versions and other platforms,
    as it's really really a simple plugin.

## Basic usage
* Use `<c-e>` under normal mode to enter HobPane.
* In HobPane<br/>
    - `,`, `.` resize the current window horizontally, the same as original `<c-w><`, `<c-w>>`.
    - `-`, `=` resize vertically, the same as original `<c-w>-`, `<c-w>+`.
    - `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` the same as `<c-w>h` etc.
    - `q` exit HobPane.

## Installation
Use your favorite vim bundle manager! Vundle is recommended (I've only tested it).
